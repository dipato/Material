Early efforts focused on creating a global standard for the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and developing the EPCglobal Network, which enabled the widespread adoption of RFID for tagging and tracking objects across supply chains.

The concept of the Web of Things (WoT) emerged during this time, where devices were treated as web resources that could be accessed and controlled through standard web technologies like HTTP. Additionally, the development of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), a lightweight HTTP-like protocol, further enhanced the integration of IoT devices with web technologies.

This generation emphasizes the storage and processing of vast amounts of data generated by IoT devices in the cloud, leveraging the scalability and on-demand resources of cloud computing. The concept of the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) emerged, where objects autonomously establish social relationships and networks, enhancing the discovery and composition of services and data. Additionally, the emerging concept of Information-Centric Networking (ICN) shifts the focus from host-based to content-based networking. This approach aims to address the scalability and efficiency challenges of IoT by focusing on efficient data distribution and retrieval.
