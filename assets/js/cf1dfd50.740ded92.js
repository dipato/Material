Processors handle the data processing and control functions, ensuring that the right actions are taken based on the analyzed information. Data storage capabilities allow for the local retention of collected data, enabling quick access and retrieval when needed.

The Proximity Network connects edge devices, such as sensors and actuators, to intermediate systems like SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), facilitating close-range communication and initial data aggregation. This network is essential for collecting and processing data at the edge, ensuring timely responses to immediate environmental changes. The Access Network, on the other hand, provides broader connectivity, enabling the transmission of data from the proximity network to higher-level application and cloud systems. This network ensures that the data collected and aggregated at the edge can be transmitted to centralized systems for further analysis, storage, and decision-making.
