They can measure a wide range of parameters, including temperature, humidity, light, motion, and pressure, among others. By collecting raw data from the physical environment, sensors provide crucial information that allows IoT systems to understand the state of their surroundings and make informed decisions. For example, temperature sensors in a smart thermostat help regulate indoor climate, motion sensors in a security system detect unauthorized movements, and light sensors in an automated lighting system adjust illumination based on ambient light conditions. These sensors form the backbone of IoT, enabling smarter, more responsive technologies."}),(0,s.jsx)(a.A,{src:n(67).A,alt:"sensors",className:"custom-img",caption:"This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-SA"}),(0,s.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"connectivity",children:"Connectivity"}),(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Connectivity refers to the communication technologies that connect sensors and other devices to the internet or to each other, enabling the transfer of data collected by sensors to processing systems and ultimately to end-users.
