# Definition of Internet of Things (IoT)
<div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
IoT represents a significant advancement in technology, transforming the way individuals interact with the world around them. Broadly defined, IoT refers to the network of physical objects, or "things," embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies, enabling them to connect and exchange data over the internet. This connectivity turns ordinary objects into intelligent, interactive devices, enriching daily lives and optimizing the use of scarce resources. From enhancing personal health to creating smarter cities, IoT leverages the availability of diverse devices and interconnection solutions, offering a conceptual framework that integrates both people and objects at a virtual level. This integration supports the development of innovative applications, illustrating the profound impact of IoT on a global scale.
